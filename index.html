            <p>I would like to visit Rio de jenerio some day because of it's famous Jesus statue,beautiful beaches and it's sugarloaf mountain.Brazilians are known for their love of music and dance. I would love the experience of the festivals held in Rio de Jenerio. Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, Carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. Rio de Janeiro's setting between the mountains and the sea is so spectacular that UNESCO cited "the staggeringly beautiful location for one of the world's biggest cities" in naming Rio a World Heritage Site.</p>
